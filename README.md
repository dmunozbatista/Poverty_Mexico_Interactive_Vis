Scroll effect that shows the difference in extreme poverty for every state; the first scroll renders orange points (2016 extreme poverty rate), the second scroll renders blue points (2022 extreme poverty rate), and the final scroll renders green/red lines to show the difference between 2016 and 2022.

### Lines Plot

Option to choose Extreme Poverty or Alimentary Poverty and another option to show the 5 states with the highest rates in 2022 or choose your own 5 states. It also has two hover effects: if you mouseover the line it will increase the stroke width and the size of the label, if you mouseover a point it will show a tooltip with the name of the state and the poverty rate for that year.
